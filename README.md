# zkIDS
### A privacy-oriented Intrusion Detection System based on Zero-Knowledge proofs
# Build Instructions
! Make sure that Docker Compose is installed
! Tested on Ubuntu 20.04
- Clone the repository
- If your Ubuntu version is > 20.04, skip building libsnark (compose will automatically build it)
- Move to libsnark directory and create the build folder 
```bash
cd libsnark && mkdir build && cd build
```
- Make sure that libsnark requisite packages are installed and Ubuntu 20.04 is in use  
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake git libgmp3-dev libprocps-dev python3-markdown libboost-program-options-dev libssl-dev python3 pkg-config
```
- Compile libsnark with the preferred compilation flags
```bash
cmake <flags> ..
```
then 
```bash
make
``` 
Tested flags: ```-DMULTICORE=ON``` and ```-DUSE_PT_COMPRESSION=OFF```

- Build the docker images from the repo root
```bash
cd ../.. && docker compose build
```
- Run the compose environment
```bash
docker compose up
```
- To control the client TLS requests, in a new terminal do 
```bash
docker attach zkids-client-1
```
If setup is finished press enter or type the URI to make the request to.
  
# Run Benchmarks
- Build the docker compose images
- In the ```vars.env``` file, set the environment variables such that TEST and RUN are set for tests, then choose the circuit to run.
- Start everything up as before
- Results are found in the ```/home/Tests``` mounted shared volume, also accessible from outside the containers and permanent.
# Create Plots
- Make sure that the generated results are in the same Tests folder as the interactive notebook 
- Open ```Plots.ipynb```
- Run any chosen section
# Use MPS IDE
- Install [MPS 3.3.5](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/download/previous.html)
- Open Project, select the MPS/xjsnark_mod directory from this repo
- If in the "Project" left sidebar xjsnark.runtime and xjsnark.sandbox give error:
    - xjsnark.runtime: Right click -> module properties
      - On the Common tab, select javaclasses on Add Model Root and select the folder containing the .class files of the xjsnark backend (should be in xjsnark_decompiled/backend_bin_mod), then remove the folder giving error
      - On the right side of the window select the just-added folder and click on Models
      - On the Java tab, add as library the same folder added in the previous step (as java_classes), then remove the folder giving error.
    - xjsnark.sandbox: Right click -> module properties
      - On the "Output Path" section, select any folder to put the java files. For example select the MPS Generated Code folder.
- To edit policies, open the xjsnark.sandbox section on the left sidebar, under "PolicyCheck" you find the three String / Merkle / Merkle Token policies for HTTP traffic
- To compile the policies, right click on either the whole xjsnark.sandbox or the single PolicyCheck module and select "Make Model" or "Make Solution". The generated java files should be in the "MPS Generated Code" folder.
